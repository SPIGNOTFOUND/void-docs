            <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Void Bot documentation! Void Bot was initially developed by our team as a solution to protect a specific server from raids. The bot's exceptional performance and user-friendly features quickly became evident. Witnessing its success and the positive impact it had on server security, we made the decision to expand its capabilities and offer it globally.</p>

            <p>Void Bot stands as a versatile, powerful companion designed to protect, entertain, and streamline your Discord server experience. Our commitment to providing premium features for free is rooted in the belief that security and functionality should be accessible to everyone, not just those willing to pay for it.</p>

            <p>What sets Void Bot apart from other solutions on the market? Let's break it down:</p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advanced Raid Protection:</strong> Utilizing cutting-edge algorithms to detect and prevent server raids, ensuring your community remains safe from harm.</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Logging:</strong> Detailed logs of all actions and events, providing complete transparency and accountability within your server.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Ban System:</strong> Report users through our dedicated server owner forum, and after proper validation, our team issue global bans to maintain safety across communities with proper proofs and links attached for everyone to refer to, to become a part of this join the support server and head towards support channel and create a ticket.</li>
                <li><strong>Server Backups:</strong> Monthly server backups to ensure you can recover your server settings and data in case of unexpected issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Customizable Cogs:</strong> Load or unload specific features based on your server's needs, giving you full control over what functionalities are active.</li>
                <li><strong>Fun and Roleplay Commands:</strong> Over 70 fun commands and more than 100 pickup line themes to keep your server engaging and entertaining.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Staff Toolkit:</strong> Comprehensive moderation tools designed to make managing your server easier and more efficient.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But why choose Void Bot over other options available? Good question! Most existing bots, like Wick or others, often fall short when it comes to providing proper logging and up-to-date features. Many are stuck in the past, offering outdated solutions. Void Bot, on the other hand, is built with modern needs in mind. We believe security is a fundamental right for every server member, not a premium service to monetize. That's why we've made all safety-related features completely free.</p>

            <p>Our unique approach doesn't stop there. With Void Bot, you get a companion that can handle anything from managing grinder funds to keeping your pool safe. It's like having a multitool for your Discord server—ready to assist with whatever you throw at it.</p>

            <p>So, whether you're looking to enhance your server's security, add some fun elements, or streamline moderation, Void Bot is here to be your ultimate Discord companion. Let's get started on making your server the best it can be!</p>

            <h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
            <p>Ready to bring Void Bot into your server and experience its full potential? Follow these detailed steps to get started on the right foot.</p>

            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
            <p>Before inviting Void Bot to your server, ensure you meet the following requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are the server owner or have administrator permissions. If you're not the main owner and the main owner is unavailable, you can still set up the bot by joining our support server where special whitelists can be created.</li>
                <li>The bot's role is set as the highest in your server hierarchy. This ensures Void Bot has the necessary permissions to function effectively and protect your server.</li>
                <li>You have a Discord account with access to the server where you want to add Void Bot.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>Inviting Void Bot to your server is a breeze—easier than mixing sugar in water, we promise! Follow these simple steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Visit the <a href="YOUR_BOT_INVITE_LINK">Void Bot invitation page</a>. This is where you'll find everything you need to add the bot to your server.</li>
                <li>Click the "Add to Server" button. This will initiate the process of inviting Void Bot to your Discord server.</li>
                <li>Select your server from the dropdown menu. If you have multiple servers, make sure to pick the right one where you want Void Bot to reside.</li>
                <li>Grant the necessary permissions. Don't worry—we only request the permissions essential for Void Bot to function properly and keep your server safe.</li>
                <li>Click "Authorize" and watch the magic happen! Void Bot will join your server and begin setting things up for you.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
            <p>Once Void Bot is in your server, it's time to configure it to your specific needs. Follow these steps for a smooth initial setup:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Run the command <code>v-setup</code> in your server. This command triggers an ephemeral guide that will walk you through the entire setup process, ensuring you don't miss any crucial steps.</li>
                <li>The bot will automatically create all necessary logging channels. These channels are where you'll find detailed records of all actions and events happening in your server, providing complete transparency and accountability.</li>
                <li>A quarantine role will be created by the bot. This role is used to isolate potentially problematic users or situations, helping to maintain server safety without disrupting the overall community experience.</li>
                <li>Void Bot will lock its (quarantine role) position right below its own role to ensure except Main owner nobody can mess up things. This ensures the bot has the necessary authority to execute its protective functions effectively.</li>
                <li>If you're on a special whitelisted server (due to the main owner being unavailable), the bot will ping the person who initiated the setup instead of the server owner for specific actions. This ensures continuity of management even in such cases.</li>
                <li>Follow the detailed guide provided by the bot to fine-tune your settings. We've added extra steps and explanations to make the setup process as smooth and user-friendly as possible.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>One of the coolest features of Void Bot is its customizable nature. You can choose to load or unload specific cogs (features) based on what your server needs. For example, if you're running a social server focused on community building, you might not need the grinder system. With a simple command, you can disable it. This level of customization puts you in full control, allowing you to tailor Void Bot to perfectly suit your server's personality and requirements.</p>

            <p>Remember, only the server owner (or the second-highest rank on whitelisted servers) can load or unload cogs. This restriction ensures that only authorized individuals can make significant changes to the bot's functionality within your server.</p>

            <p>With these steps completed, your server's safety system is up and running, and you're ready to explore all the amazing features Void Bot has to offer. From advanced protection to fun roleplay commands, the possibilities are endless!</p>
